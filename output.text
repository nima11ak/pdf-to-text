The English Wikipedia is the primary[a] English-language edition of
Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. It was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry
Sanger on 15 January 2001, as Wikipedia's first edition.
English Wikipedia is hosted alongside other language editions by the
Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization. Its content,
written independently of other editions by volunteer editors known as
Wikipedians,[1] is in various varieties of English while aiming to stay
consistent within articles. Its internal newspaper is The Signpost.
English Wikipedia is the most read version of Wikipedia,[2][3] accounting
for 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining percentage
split among the other languages.[4] The English Wikipedia has the most
articles of any edition, at 7,000,464 as of May 2025.[b] It contains 10.8%
of articles in all Wikipedias,[b] although it lacks millions of articles
found in other editions.[1] The edition's one-billionth edit was made on
13 January 2021.[5]
English Wikipedia, often as a stand-in for Wikipedia overall, has been
praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of
coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced degree of commercial
bias. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly
gender bias against women and ideological bias.[6][7] While its
reliability was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over
time, receiving greater praise in the late 2010s and early
2020s,[8][6][9][c] having become an important fact-checking site.[10][11]
English Wikipedia has been characterized as having less cultural bias than
other language editions due to its broader editor base.[2]

The English Wikipedia surpassed six million articles on 23 January
2020.[12] In November 2022, the total volume of the compressed texts of
its articles amounted to 20 gigabytes.[13]
The edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 2021 by Ser
Amantio di Nicolao (Steven Pruitt) who as of that date is the user with
the highest number of edits on the English Wikipedia, at over four
million.[5] Currently, there are 7,000,464 articles created with 937,572
files. The encyclopedia is home to 10.8% of articles in all Wikipedias
(down from more than 50% in 2003).[14][15] The English Wikipedia currently
has 49,203,415 registered accounts of which 840 are administrators.
Bureaucracy
Editors of the English Wikipedia have pioneered some ideas as conventions,
policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in
some of the other languages. These ideas include "featured articles",[16]
the neutral-point-of-view policy,[17] navigation templates,[18] the
sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[19] dispute
resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[20] and weekly
collaborations.[21]

Edits to English Wikipedia by country as of January 2022
English Wikipedia (marked blue in the graph) is the most-read version of
Wikipedia, accounting for 48% of the website's global traffic as of 2021.
The English Wikipedia is the most edited Wikipedia's language version of
all time.
The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1
April 2007,[22] over a year since the millionth Wikipedian registered an
account in February 2006.[23]
Over 1,100,000 volunteer editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10
times.[24] Over 30,000 editors perform more than 5 edits per month, and
over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits per month.[25]
On 1 March 2014, The Economist, in an article titled "The Future of
Wikipedia", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the
Wikimedia Foundation stating that "[t]he number of editors for the
English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years."[26] The
attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The
Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in
other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the
number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was
relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at
approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about
2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English
Wikipedia, by "sharp" comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at
approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.
The trend analysis published in The Economist presents Wikipedia in other
languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active
editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining
relatively constant at approximately 42,000.[26]
The English Wikipedia has the Arbitration Committee (also known as ArbCom)
that consists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with
regard to disputes between other editors of the online encyclopedia.[27]
It was created by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the
decision-making power he had formerly held as owner of the site.[28][29]
When it was founded, the committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided
into three groups of four members each.[28][30]
In 2022, for English Wikipedia, Americans accounted for about 40% of
active editors, followed by British and Indian editors accounting for
about 10% of each, and Canadian and Australian at about 5%.[31]
Criticism
Two radically different versions of the Wikipedia biography Klee Irwin
(now deleted)[32] presented to the public within days of each other:
Wikipedia's susceptibility to edit wars and bias is an issue often raised
by the project's critics.
The free online encyclopedia Wikipedia has been criticized since its
creation in 2001. Most of the criticism has been directed toward its
content, community of established volunteer users, process, and rules.
Critics have questioned its factual reliability, the readability and
organization of its articles, the lack of methodical fact-checking, and
its political bias.
Concerns have also been raised about systemic bias along gender, racial,
political, corporate, institutional, and national lines. Conflicts of
interest arising from corporate campaigns to influence content have also
been highlighted. Further concerns include the vandalism and partisanship
facilitated by anonymous editing, clique behavior (from contributors as
well as administrators and other top figures), social stratification
between a guardian class and newer users, excessive rule-making, edit
warring, and uneven policy application.

English varieties
A notable discussion within the English Wikipedia community concerns the
preference for national variety of the English language, particularly
American English and British English.[33] Various suggestions have been
made, ranging from standardizing a single form of English to creating
separate versions of the English Wikipedia project.[citation needed]
According to a style guideline, "the English Wikipedia has no general
preference for a major national variety of the language" and "an article
on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation
uses the appropriate variety of English for that nation."[34]
Disputed articles
A 2013 study from Oxford University found that the most disputed articles
on the English Wikipedia tend to address broader, global issues. In
contrast, articles on other language Wikipedias often focus on regional
issues. This pattern is attributed to the status of English as a global
lingua franca, leading to contributions from many editors for whom English
is a second language. The study identified the most disputed entries on
the English Wikipedia as George W. Bush, anarchism, Muhammad, list of WWE
personnel, global warming, circumcision, United States, Jesus, race and
intelligence, and Christianity.[35]
2024 research determined that several groups of connected accounts had
coordinated to promote Russian propaganda narratives and state-controlled
media sources in articles, related to Russian-Ukrainian relations and
Russia's war with Ukraine.[36][37]
Threats against high schools
There have been reports of threats of violence against high schools made
on Wikipedia.[38][39][40] In 2006, a 14-year-old was arrested for making a
threat against Niles West High School on Wikipedia.[41] In 2008, Glen A.
Wilson High School was the subject of such a threat.[38][39][40]
WikiProjects and assessment
Main article: WikiProject
"Good articles on Wikipedia" redirects here. For the Wikipedia project
page, see Wikipedia:Good articles.
A "WikiProject" is a group of contributors who want to work together as a
team to improve Wikipedia. These groups may focus on a specific topic area
(for example, women's history), a specific location or a specific kind of
task (for example, checking newly created pages). As of August 2022, the
English Wikipedia had over 2,000 WikiProjects, for which activity
varied.[42]
In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English
Wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles.[43]
Articles are rated by WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins
with "Stub" (very short pages), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in
increasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the
article to enter one of the quality classes: either "good article", "A" or
the highest, "featured article". Of the about 6.5 million articles and
lists assessed as of April 2022, more than 6,000 (0.09%) are featured
articles, and fewer than 4,000 (0.06%) are featured lists. One featured
article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main page of
Wikipedia.[44][45]
Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured
status via the intensive work of a few editors.[46] A 2010 study found
unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the
community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles.[47]
Internal news publications

Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.[48] Other
community news publications include the "WikiWorld" web comic, the
Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like
The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter
from The Guild of Copy Editors. There are a number of publications from
the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the
Wikimedia Blog and This Month in Education.

Notes
The other edition is Simple English Wikipedia, which uses Basic English.
The number of articles on the English Wikipedia is shown by the MediaWiki
variable {{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}, with all Wikipedias as total
{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|total}} = 64,993,524.
Despite this praise, Wikipedia does not recognize itself as a reliable
source.
